<div>Congratualations on solving the Baby Elevator! Most people were satisfied with your elevator service... I guess.</div>
<div><br>Today is a new day. The same people need to get to the same places. However, unfortunately Andrea Kwan was too impatient with one of our elevators and jammed the system. </div> <div>Due to improper treatment, Elevator 2 now moves at HALF the speed as Elevator 1. <i>This means that Elevator 2 takes two seconds to move up and down a floor rather than one second.</i></div>
<div><br>Shoot for the best score possible! People don't like to wait for elevators.</div>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<span>Your final score = the average total wait time (time between when a passenger requests an elevator and when they are dropped off).</span>
</div>
