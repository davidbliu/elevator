<div>We live in a world full of cooties. People hate the opposite sex. </div>
<div>Do not... I mean DO NOT have a guy and a girl in the elevator at the same time.</div>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<div><span>NOTE: If you have a guy and a girl in the elevator at the same time, your solution will be invalid and you will have to try the problem again </span>
	</div>
<span>Your final score = the average total wait time (time between when a passenger requests an elevator and when they are dropped off)</span>
</div>
