<div>I don't know about you, but a lot of people think Berkeley elevators can be some of the sketchiest elevators out there.</div>
<div>Quachy was one day making his way through a Berkeley apartment complex, all ready for his date. He opened the door and stepped into the elevator.</div>
<div>The elevator broke.</div>
<div>Quachy is stuck.</div>

<br>
<div> Moral of the story. Don't be like Quachy, keep your people happy despite the broken elevator.</div>

<div> <b> In this challenge, elevator 2 will break at time 50. It will break for a total of 60 seconds. Take this into account when designing our elevator schedule. </b></div>

<h3>Scoring</h3>
<span>Your final score = the average total wait time (time between when a passenger requests an elevator and when they are dropped off) </span>
</div>
